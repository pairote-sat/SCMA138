    "\n",
    "2. **Asymmetry:**\n",

    "* Insurers may need to account for this asymmetry when conducting risk analysis and financial planning.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Magnitude:**\n",
    "\n",
    "* With a skewness of approximately 0.276, the positive skewness is relatively small, suggesting that the asymmetry in the distribution is not very pronounced.\n",
    "\n",
    "* While there is some skewness present, it may not have a significant impact on risk assessment and premium calculation compared to distributions with larger skewness values.\n",

    "    * This test compares the empirical cumulative distribution function of the data to the cumulative distribution function of a normal distribution.\n",
    "    * If the test statistic is not significant at a chosen significance level, it suggests that the data is normally distributed.\n",

    "    * If the resulting statistic is less than the critical value at a chosen significance level, it supports the hypothesis that the data is normally distributed.\n",

    "\n",
    "For example, in **pricing insurance premiums**, actuaries use actuarial models to estimate the expected claims costs based on factors such as policyholder demographics, historical loss experience, and market trends. By incorporating these factors into the model, insurers can accurately price their products to cover anticipated claims while remaining competitive in the market.\n",
    "\n",
    "In **reserving, actuarial models** are used to estimate the amount of money insurers need to set aside to cover future claim payments. These models take into account factors such as the development of claims over time, the likelihood of claims being reported, and the severity of potential losses. By regularly updating reserves based on actuarial modeling results, insurers can ensure they have sufficient funds to meet their obligations to policyholders.\n",
    "\n",
    "Similarly, actuarial models play a crucial role in **underwriting decisions** by assessing the risk profile of potential policyholders and determining appropriate coverage levels and premiums. These models analyze various risk factors, such as health status, driving behavior, or property characteristics, to evaluate the likelihood of claims and set pricing accordingly.\n",
