# Welcome to SCMA 138 Principles of Actuarial Science


Welcome to "**Introduction to Actuarial Science!**" In this course, we'll cover the essential actuarial concepts, emphasizing a solid understanding of foundational principles (CLO1). We'll then move on to explore basic risk management techniques within the context of actuarial science (CLO2). Hands-on learning is central to our approach, with a focus on applying Excel's functions to solve actuarial problems, including calculations related to present value and future value (CLO3). To tie it all together, we'll engage in a comprehensive case study using Excel as a key analytical tool, offering a practical understanding of actuarial and financial business scenarios (CLO4). Get ready to dive into the world of actuarial science!
