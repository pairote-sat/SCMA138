    "\n",
    "- An actuarial model is essentially a mathematical representation of one or more risks that actuaries use to understand and manage those risks.\n",
    "- Actuarial values are numerical values assigned to specific sets of risks, determined using these models.\n",
    "- Participants in the process assign a degree of confidence to these values, believing that higher confidence reflects values closer to the truth.\n",

    "**Stochastic vs. Deterministic Models**\n",
    "\n",
    "- Actuarial phenomena are inherently uncertain, but actuarial models can represent risks in two ways: stochastically or deterministically.\n",
    "- Stochastic models incorporate probability distributions to represent risk variables, essential for determining failure probabilities.\n",
    "- Deterministic models use sets of fixed values, often representing the means of underlying distributions.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Principles Behind Actuarial Modeling**\n",
    "\n",
    "- Actuarial models can be based on outcomes of experiments, observations, or knowledge related to the phenomenon itself.\n",
    "- They allow for understanding the likelihood of failure relative to specific criteria over a defined period.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Interconnected Components**\n",
    "\n",
    "- Components of an actuarial model can be interdependent. For instance, certain risks may be related, and changing one variable may affect others.\n",
    "- Actuarial risks often lead to rights or obligations involving cash transactions, such as insurance payouts or premiums.\n",
