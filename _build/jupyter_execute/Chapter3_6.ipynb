    "The **survival model** is a foundational concept in actuarial science and statistical modeling.\n",
    "\n",
    "The survival model treats the **future lifetime** of an individual as a continuous random variable, forming the basis for various actuarial and statistical analyses. Let us explore its key components and applications:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Continuous Random Variable**: The lifetime of an individual is represented as a continuous random variable, allowing for precise modeling and analysis.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Survival Function**: Denoted as $ S(t) $, the survival function represents the probability that an individual survives beyond time $ t $. It is defined as $ S(t) = \\mathbb{P}(T > t) $, where $ T $ is the random variable representing lifetime.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Hazard Function**: The hazard function, denoted as $ \\mu(t) $ or $ h(t) $, represents the instantaneous rate of mortality at time $ t $, given survival up to that time. It is defined as $ \\mu(t) = \\frac{f(t)}{S(t)} $, where $ f(t) $ is the probability density function of the lifetime.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Applications**:\n",
    "   - **Life Insurance**: Assessing risk, determining premiums, and managing financial obligations.\n",
    "   - **Pension Plans**: Estimating liabilities, making strategic investment decisions.\n",
    "   - **Healthcare Planning**: Resource allocation, preventive healthcare strategies.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. **Extensions**:\n",
    "   - **Insurance Policy Duration**: Analyzing policyholder behavior, predicting policy durations.\n",
    "   - **Healthcare Analysis**: Assessing disease progression, planning interventions.\n",
    "\n",
    "The survival model's versatility extends beyond mortality to other domains such as insurance policy duration and healthcare analysis.\n"
