    "\n",
    "**Cashflow models** provide a framework for analyzing the inflows and outflows of cash over time, enabling informed decision-making in resource allocation, project evaluation, and financial planning. However, cashflows are not equal across time due to the **time value of money principle**, which asserts that a dollar today is worth more than a dollar in the future due to its potential earning capacity if invested. This principle underscores the importance of considering the timing of cashflows and the associated opportunity cost in financial decision-making.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Interest rates** play a pivotal role in determining the time value of money, representing the cost of borrowing or the return on investment. They significantly influence the present and future value of cashflows, whether it's the interest earned on savings accounts, the cost of borrowing for a mortgage, or the discount rate used in cashflow models. \n",
