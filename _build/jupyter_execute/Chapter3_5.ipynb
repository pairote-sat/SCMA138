    "$$\\text{PV=Premium=Expected Future Claims+Administrative Costs+Profit Margin\n",

    "- $\\text{Expected Future Claims}$ represents the expected amount the insurer will need to pay out in death benefits over the life of the policy.\n",

    "- $\\text{Profit Margin}$ is the additional amount the insurer seeks to cover its overhead costs and generate a profit.\n",
    "\n",
    "To determine the fair premium, actuaries use various mathematical models and actuarial assumptions to estimate the expected future claims, administrative costs, and desired profit margin. They then solve for the premium that satisfies the equation of value, ensuring that the insurer can meet its obligations while remaining financially viable.\n",
    "\n",
    "For instance, if the expected future claims over the life of the policy are estimated to be \\$70,000, administrative costs amount to \\$10,000, and the desired profit margin is \\$20,000, then the fair premium would be:\n",
