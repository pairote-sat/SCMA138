    "- **Coin Toss Experiment:** Imagine flipping a fair coin repeatedly. Initially, the empirical probability of landing heads may fluctuate, but as the number of flips increases, it tends to stabilize around the theoretical probability of 0.5. This convergence demonstrates the Law of Large Numbers in action, as the observed empirical probability aligns more closely with the theoretical probability with a larger number of trials.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Dice Rolling Experiment:** Similarly, consider rolling a fair six-sided die multiple times. Initially, the empirical probability of rolling a specific number may vary, but with more rolls, it tends to approach the theoretical probability of 1/6 for each face of the die. Again, this exemplifies how the Law of Large Numbers manifests the convergence of empirical probabilities towards theoretical expectations with increased trials.\n"
